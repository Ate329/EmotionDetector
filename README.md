SentiMusic is an innovative project that bridges the gap between your emotions and the music. It utilises the power of artificial intelligence to transform the sentiment of your text into a unique and personalised musical piece.

1. Input a sentence, a paragraph or a story.
2. SentiMusic analyses the sentiment of your text.
3. Based on the emotions it finds, SentiMusic creates a unique piece of music that reflects your words.
